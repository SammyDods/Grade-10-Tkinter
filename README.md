# Grade 10 Tkinter
 This is a GUI calculator I made in grade 10 using the Tkinter module

In grade 10 I thought I was quite smart to use string manipulation then "eval" to perform calculations. 

In hindsight I could have improved the calculator by performing calculations on individual terms rather than the whole product.
